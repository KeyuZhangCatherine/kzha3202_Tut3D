The artwork is Broadway Boogie Woogie, painted by Piet Mondrian. It is inspired by clear real-world examples: the city grid of Manhattan, and boogie-woogie, a type of African-American music.
Therefore, the music I chose to add to the design was jazz, which has a bright rhythm and a wide range of frequencies.

Add the amplituation.getLevel () and fft.analyze(), the volume and spectrum information can be obtained. The information is mapped to the size of the rectangle.
The size, colour and alpha of rectangles can be changed following the information of volume and spectrum. 
The rotation is added to have more visual effect.
Add changing height and changing colour following the spectrum information into the background horizontal and vertical streets. Use the energy in the bass frequency.
Add the navigation “Click to play/pause the music” to help users get access to how to start.
